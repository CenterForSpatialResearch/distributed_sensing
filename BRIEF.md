# Distributed Sensing

## Concept

A distributed repository for participatory sensing data from mobile devices, including geospatial data, that allows for independent without proprietary platforms.


### Background

Over the last ten years, geolocation data have become central to all aspects of everyday life. Position—as determined via individuals' mobile devices—is now a primary metric across industries, and as digital logics organize space, the means through which data are collected have become key infrastructure. Geolocation data are of particular importance given the recent explosion of artificial intelligence. Applied to algorithmic decision making, AI is poised to radically transform business, government, and the ways in which culture is mediated by leveraging its knowledge about the position of people and things.

However, the data through which geographic dynamics are understood are largely proprietary. As a result, the capacity to correlate geolocation with other data, such as purchasing patterns, biometric signals, environmental sensing, resource allocation, and social media behavior, is significantly concentrated with corporate platforms, as is the inability of the public to audit and redress bias in automated systems. Consider Alphabet's Sidewalk Toronto initiative, in which the software giant can confidently assert its ability to build a city “from the internet up” in a way that is explicitly informed by private data collected by Google in cities throughout the world. That opportunity is not available to civic institutions, and as such is indicative of how private data lead to the privatization of the public sector.

Additionally, it is clear that traditional academic methodologies are insufficient to assess the sociotechnological effects of big data and machine learning. Methods that account for data-driven systems are forced to piggyback off the limited data made available by commercial platforms that are inevitably subject to the bias inherent in their construction. Government data are no substitute, as their vitality is increasingly under threat in the current political climate. And systems explicitly built for academic purposes are subject to institutional contraints of hosting and maintenance costs and an inability to scale. Ultimately, all this presents an problem of epistemology whereby data-driven knowledge is bound to capital.

One possible means of mitigation is the decentralized web. This is nascent set of concepts, tools, and aspirations to remake some of the fundamental protocols of the internet such that they conform to its original vision of a distributed information architecture. It is in part driven by the success of the [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) protocol. Core tenets of the decentralized web include peer-to-peer networking and data transfer, resiliency and data redundancy, and assurances of data integrity and security on the protocol level. These ensure centralized services do not have privileged control over data as the infrastructure is kept separate from the data itself. This also means that in theory the decentralized web cannot be censored, and it can be accessed in conflict areas that might otherwise be subject to corporate and state collusion.

Our concept is simple (in principle): mobile apps that capture information from the devices' sensors and publish them over a peer-to-peer network. This allows both individual access to one's own data as well as the sharing of data outside of a centralized platform. The result is therefore a scalable way to do independent data-driven research.


### Goals

- Open source to allow clients to be upated and built beyond C4SR
- A transparent and self-maintaining approach to privacy
- A data format that easily integrates with geospatial software (QGIS, Mapbox) and machine learning (Keras / Torch?)
- Available to prior OpenPaths users, acadmic researchers, and the public
