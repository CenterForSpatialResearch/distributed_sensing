# HyFA.net

**Hy**percore **F**eed **A**ggregator Network is a peer-to-peer system for securely sharing data from sensors. Stream geolocation data from your mobile phone to your laptop, for example, or get updates from a network of water quality monitors, all without setting up a server.

HyFA uses [hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore), the logging system that powers [DAT](https://datproject.org), but it does not use DAT's more advanced file-management features. Instead, it deploys hypercore directly as an unalterable live feed of sensor readings.
