After setting build configuration to release in the location_tracker scheme, I ran into several errors. Here they are in the order I encountered them and what I did to fixe them. Note: they could probably be combined in a smarter way so you don't have to keep cleaning and re-building from scratch.

Error:Fix

Mapbox Framework Not Found: Make sure you have “$(PROJECT_DIR)/../node_modules/@mapbox/react-native-mapbox-gl/ios” listed as a framework search paths in RELEASE mode. Might need to set to recursive.

library not found for -lRNNodeJsMobile: Set your target iOS to >11.0. I am running 12.2 so I set it to that.

A bunch of errors (52) about compiling to arm64 when it should be compiled to armv7: There are a lot of suggestions surrounding this one. What I got to work was to
1. Under build settings > Architectures > Valid Architectures remove arm64 and arm64e (should only be armv7 and armv7s
2. Set “Build Active Architecture Only” to Yes (a lot of people say to set to No)
3. In command line in location_tracker directory:
	$ rm -rf node_modules
	$ rm -rf ios/build
	$ npm install
	$ npm audit fix
	$ react-native link
4. Clean build (cmd+shift+K) in Xcode and re-run

Mapbox error having to do with stripping frameworks: Remove armv7 and add arm64 back to architectures; clean and rebuild
